## About

The Chatbot project is an interactive conversational agent that utilizes machine learning to understand and respond to user input. It is trained on a dataset of intents, allowing it to recognize various user queries and generate appropriate responses. The chatbot can be used in a variety of applications, including customer support, virtual assistants, and more.

## Files

The repository contains the following files:

- [chatbot.py](chatbot.py) - Python script for implementing the chatbot.
- [chatbot_model.h5](chatbot_model.h5) - Trained machine learning model for the chatbot.
- [classes.pkl](classes.pkl) - Pickle file containing the classes associated with intents.
- [intents.json](intents.json) - JSON file with labeled intents and responses for training the chatbot.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Chatbot project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository** locally using `git clone [repository_url]`.
2. **Install the required Python packages** if needed.
3. **Run the `chatbot.py` script** to start the chatbot.
4. **Input your queries** to interact with the chatbot.
5. **The chatbot will process your input** and generate appropriate responses.

## Usage

The chatbot is trained on a dataset of labeled intents, allowing it to recognize user queries and provide relevant responses. It uses natural language processing techniques and a machine learning model to understand and generate responses. The performance of the chatbot can be improved by training it on a larger and more diverse dataset.
